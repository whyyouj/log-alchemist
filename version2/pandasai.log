                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent user?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with component kernel occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many rows are there in the dataset?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many rows are there in the dataset?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many rows are there in the dataset?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        How many times did the event with eventid E189 occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with eventid E189 occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with eventid E189 occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event E189 occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event E189 occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event E189 occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event E189 occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with component kernel occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with component kernel occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with component kernel occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with component kernel occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:

                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The most frequent eventid is {common_eventid}.'}
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'], errors='coerce')
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The most frequent eventid is {common_eventid}.'}

It fails with the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

    return self._range.index(new_key)
ValueError: 0 is not in range

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode().iloc[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].value_counts().idxmax()
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': common_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The most frequent eventid is {common_eventid}.'}
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The most frequent eventid is {common_eventid}.'}

It fails with the following error:

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The most frequent eventid is {common_eventid}.'}

It fails with the following error:

        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode().iloc[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].value_counts().idxmax()
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': common_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode().iloc[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}

# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode().iloc[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].value_counts().idxmax()
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': common_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
most_frequent_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].mode().iloc[0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': most_frequent_eventid}
dfs[0]['EventId'] = pd.to_numeric(dfs[0]['EventId'])
common_eventid = dfs[0]['EventId'].value_counts().idxmax()
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': common_eventid}

It fails with the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:

# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent eventid that occurred?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.

                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        What is the total number of errors and warnings are recorded in this log?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the total number of errors and warnings are recorded in this log?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

        What is the total number of errors and warnings are recorded in this log?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the total number of errors and warnings are recorded in this log?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent user?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['User'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[0]['Datetime']).dt.date
most_frequent_user = dfs[0]['User'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': most_frequent_user}

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent user?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['User'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[0]['Datetime']).dt.date
most_frequent_user = dfs[0]['User'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': most_frequent_user}

It fails with the following error:

                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent user?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent user?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['User'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[0]['Datetime']).dt.date
most_frequent_user = dfs[0]['User'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': most_frequent_user}

It fails with the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\regan\Documents\NUS\NUS Modules\Year 4 Semester 1\BT4103\.venv\lib\site-packages\pandasai\pipelines\chat\code_execution.py", line 97, in execute
    raise InvalidOutputValueMismatch(

        The following is the query from the user:
        What is the most frequent user?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

You generated this python code:
dfs[0]['User'] = pd.to_datetime(dfs[0]['Datetime']).dt.date
most_frequent_user = dfs[0]['User'].mode()[0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': most_frequent_user}

It fails with the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\regan\Documents\NUS\NUS Modules\Year 4 Semester 1\BT4103\.venv\lib\site-packages\pandasai\pipelines\chat\code_execution.py", line 97, in execute
    raise InvalidOutputValueMismatch(
pandasai.exceptions.InvalidOutputValueMismatch: Value type <class 'datetime.date'> must match with type string


Fix the python code above and return the new python code:

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many missing values are there in Address?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

### QUERY
 
        The following is the query from the user:
        How many times did the event with component kernel occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

        How many times did the event with the user authorMacBook-Pro occur?

        You are to respond with a code output that answers the user query. The code must not be a function and must not have a return statement.

        You are to following the instructions below strictly:
        - Any query related to Date or Time, refer to the 'Datetime' column.
        - Any query related to ERROR, WARNING or EVENT, refer to the EventTemplate column.
        

Variable `dfs: list[pd.DataFrame]` is already declared.

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

If you are asked to plot a chart, use "matplotlib" for charts, save as png.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.

                You are a highly skilled data analysis agent, responsible for handling and answering various data-related queries. 
                For each query I provide, your task is to carefully analyze the data and return the most accurate and optimized solution.
                
                Your response should include:
                1. The Python code necessary to derive the answer from the data.
                
                Always take your time to think through the query before responding, and ensure the code is optimized for both readability and performance.
                
                Typical questions you will handle include requests like "How many rows are there in the dataset?" or "What are the top 5 events that occurred?" so ensure your answers are tailored to these types of queries.
